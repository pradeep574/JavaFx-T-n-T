The objective of T ‘n’ T is to get 3 Xs or 3 Os in a row where each X or O is
actually a smaller tic tac toe game that has been won by the X player or the O player
respectively. The first player may make his move in any square of any local board.
The set of possible moves either player has on his turn from then on depends on the
move made by the previous player, i.e, a move made in a square of a local board
forces the other player to play in a square of a local board in the corresponding
position of the global board. If a player is forced to play in a local board which is full,
he may play in any square of his choice. Unlike in Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, players may
be forced to play in local boards which have already been won.
